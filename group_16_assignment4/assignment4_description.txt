Our animation is about an alien UFO taking a car at night. There are three classes: Firework, vehicle, and UFO. 
Het did the Firework part that stars can both move and rotate.
Jiajun did the vehicle part that the car can move forward and also the wheels can spin.
Lauren did the UFO part that the UFO can move and also the airscrew can spin.
We had some difficulties of control and calculate the speed.
Extra credit:
we add the super mario song as the background music after the car disappeared.
